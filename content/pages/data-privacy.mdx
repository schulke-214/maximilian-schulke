In the following, I would like to inform you about the processing of your personal data by me and the claims and rights to which you are entitled according to the data protection regulations, in particular the European Data Protection Basic Regulation (DSGVO).

This data protection information informs you about the type, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data within my website (hereinafter referred to as "website"). The data protection information applies regardless of the domains, platforms and devices used (e.g. desktop, mobile, etc.).

Personal data in the sense of the DSGVO are all data that can be related to you personally, e.g. name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour. Which data is processed in detail and how it is used depends largely on the services I use.

I use various other terms in this data protection information in accordance with the DSGVO. These include terms such as processing, restriction of processing, profiling, pseudonymisation, person responsible, processor, recipient, third party, consent, supervisory authority and international organisation. Art. 4 DSGVO, you can find corresponding definitions for these terms.

## 1. Who is responsible for data processing and whom can I contact?

The responsible person is:<br />
Maximilian Schulke<br />
Am Filmlager 8<br />
12555 Berlin<br />
Germany

phone: <a href="tel:+4915144573027">+49 151 44 57 30 27</a><br />
mail: legal@maximilianschulke.com<br />

## 2. What sources and data do i use?

I process personal data that I receive from you in the course of using this website.

When using the website for purely informational purposes, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise provide me with information, I only collect the personal data that your browser sends to my  server. When you call up my website, I collect the following access data, which is technically necessary for me to display my website and to ensure its stability and security. The access data includes the IP address, date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), content of the request (i.e. name of the specific web page accessed), access status/HTTP status code, amount of data transferred in each case, referrer URL (previously visited page), operating system and its interface, language and version as well as type of browser software, notification of successful access.

Furthermore, I will receive your personal data if you contact me via contact form or e-mail. Personal data are here e.g. name, address, e-mail, telephone number and if applicable the data you send us as a message (hereinafter referred to as "contact data").

## 3. For what purpose do I process your data (purpose of processing) and on what legal basis?

I process personal data in accordance with the provisions of the European Data Protection Basic Regulation (DS-GVO) and the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) on the following legal basis:

### 3.1 On the basis of your consent, Art. 6 para. 1a DS-GVO

If you have given me your consent to process personal data for specific purposes, in particular to contact you (e.g. via my  contact form or by e-mail for processing and handling your enquiry, sending newsletters, advertising by telephone, e-mail, SMS etc.), the legality of this processing is based on your consent.

A given consent can be revoked at any time. Please note that the revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before the revocation is therefore not affected by the revocation. The revocation can be sent to the above mentioned contact data or to legal@maximilianschulke.com.

### 3.2 For the implementation of pre-contractual measures at the request of the person, Art. 6 para. 1b DS-GVO

When you contact me (via contact form or e-mail), your data will be processed not only with regard to any consent you may have given for the processing of the contact request and its handling, but also on the basis of the implementation of pre-contractual measures, Art. 6 para. 1b DSGVO.

### 3.3 Within the framework of the balancing of interests for the protection of legitimate interests, Art. 6 para. 1f DSGVO

I process your access data (see data listed above under point 2) in order to protect legitimate interests of myself or third parties. In particular, I pursue the following legitimate interests:

- ensuring IT security, in particular the security of the website;
- advertising or market and opinion research, provided that you have not objected to the use of your data;
- assertion of legal claims and defence in the event of legal disputes;

## 4. Who gets my data?

I process the majority of the data by myself.

Even processors employed by me (Art. 28 DSGVO) may receive data for the above-mentioned purposes. These are companies in the categories of IT services, telecommunications, consulting and advisory services, and sales and marketing. If i use contract processors to provide my  services, I take appropriate legal precautions as well as appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of personal data in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.

Data will only be passed on to third parties within the scope of the legal requirements. I will only pass on users' data to third parties if this is necessary, for example, on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) DSGVO for contractual purposes or on the basis of legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO in an economic and effective operation of my  business or if you have consented to the transfer of data. In the case of purely informational use of the website, i do not pass on any data to third parties.


## 5. How long will my data be stored?

For security reasons (e.g. to clarify acts of abuse or fraud), log file information is stored for a maximum of 52 days and then deleted (see point 2 above). Data whose further storage is required for evidential purposes is excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.

Where necessary, i process and store your personal data for the duration of mybusiness relationship, which also includes, for example, the initiation and execution of a contract via contact form or e-mail.

In addition, I am subject to various storage and documentation obligations, which result from the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Fiscal Code (AO), among others. The periods of retention or documentation stipulated there are two to ten years.

Finally, the duration of storage is also assessed according to the statutory periods of limitation, which, for example, according to §§ 195 ff. of the German Civil Code (BGB), are usually three years, but in certain cases can be up to thirty years, whereby the regular period of limitation is three years.

## 6. Is data transferred to a third country or to an international organisation?

The data provided will be processed within the European Union and in the USA. Please note that I will either ensure with recipients of your data for states without a Commission adequacy decision under Article 45 DSGVO, as is the case with the USA, that they are either certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield (such as Google) or have agreed EU standard data protection clauses with these recipients. This is in order to protect your data and to achieve an adequate level of protection for your personal data. You have the opportunity to obtain a copy of the EU standard data protection clauses or to view them. If necessary, please contact us using the contact details given in point 1 above.

## 7. What data protection rights do I have?

Every person concerned has

- the right to information in accordance with Art. 15 DSGVO (i.e. you have the right to request information about your personal data stored by us at any time)
- the right of rectification under Art. 16 DSGVO (i.e. in the event that your personal data is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that it be corrected)
- the right of deletion in accordance with Art. 17 DSGVO and the right to restrict processing in accordance with Art. 18 DSGVO (i.e. you may have the right to request deletion or restriction of the processing of your personal data if, for example, there is no longer a legitimate business purpose for such processing and statutory storage obligations do not require further storage),
- the right to data transferability under Art. 20 DSGVO (i.e. you may have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided us with in a structured, common and machine-readable format and to transfer this data to another person responsible without hindrance)

Furthermore, you may revoke your consent, in principle with effect for the future.

In addition, you have the right of appeal to a data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 DS-GVO in conjunction with § 19 BDSG). You can find the supervisory authority responsible for you at https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.

I would also like to draw your attention to your right of objection under Art. 21 DS-GVO:
Information on your right of objection under Art. 21 DS-GVO

You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter e of the DPA (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f of the basic data protection regulation (data processing based on a balancing of interests).

If you lodge an objection, I will no longer process your personal data unless i can demonstrate compelling reasons for processing that are worthy of protection and outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

In individual cases I process your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. You have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such direct marketing, including profiling, insofar as it is connected with such direct marketing. If you object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing, I will no longer process your personal data for those purposes.

The objection can be made without any formality and no costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs are incurred.

If possible, the objection should be addressed to:

Maximilian Schulke<br />
Am Filmlager 8<br />
12555 Berlin<br />
Germany

or mail it to:

legal@maximilianschulke.com

## 8. To what extent is there automated decision making in individual cases including profiling?

When accessing my website or contacting me by form or e-mail, I do not use fully automated automatic decision making in accordance with Article 22 DSGVO. Should I use these procedures in individual cases, I will inform you separately, provided this is required by law. I do not process your data automatically with the aim of evaluating certain personal aspects (profiling).

## 9. Is there an obligation for me to provide data?

As part of my website, you must provide the personal data that is technically or for IT security reasons necessary for the use of my website. If you do not provide the aforementioned data, you cannot use my website.

When contacting me by form or e-mail, you only have to provide the personal data that is necessary to process your request. Otherwise i will not be able to process your request.

## 10. Cookies

I use cookies on my Internet pages. Cookies are small text files, usually consisting of letters and numbers, which are stored on the user's computer when visiting certain internet pages.

Some of these cookies are essential for the functioning of my website, while other cookies help me to improve my website by giving me insight into how you use the website.

By default I only use necessary cookies. Necessary cookies enable the core functionalities of my website. The website cannot be displayed correctly without these cookies or individual areas may not function properly. Necessary cookies can only be prevented by appropriate settings in your browser.

I only use cookies that are not necessary for the functioning of the website ("non-essential cookies") if you have given your consent via my cookie banner. You can return to my data protection information at any time and withdraw your consent or make changes.

You can get information about the cookies i use at any time via the footer section of the website or

The following additional possibilities exist with regard to cookies:

> If you do not want cookies to be stored on your computer, you can deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of your browser. Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings of your browser. Please note that deactivating cookies can lead to functional limitations of this website.
> You can object to the use of cookies that are used for reach measurement and advertising purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and additionally the US website (http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or the European website (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/).

## 11. Google Analytics

On the basis of my legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of my online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1f DSGVO), I use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the website by the user is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Google is certified under the Privacy-Shield-Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with the European data protection law (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

Google will use this information on my behalf to evaluate the use of my  website by users, to compile reports on the activities within this website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of this website and the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous user profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.

I only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymisation. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting their browser software accordingly; users can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online offer to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

If users have activated the "Do not Track" setting of their browser, I accept this and prevent tracking by Google Analytics as well as loading the scripts.

Further information on data use by Google, setting and objection options can be found on the websites of Google: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners ("Data use by Google when you use websites or apps of my  partners"), https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads ("Data use for advertising purposes"), https://www.google.de/settings/ads ("Manage information that Google uses to show you advertising").

## 12. Other Services

I use service offers from third parties on my website within the scope of my  legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1f DSGVO, i.e. my interest in an optimal web presence. The IP address of the user is transmitted to these third parties. The IP address is technically necessary for the content to be displayed. Third party providers may use so-called web pixels (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for evaluation or marketing purposes. Web pixels can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the website using them. The third party providers may store information in cookies on the user's device.

I use the following third-party providers on my website:

- Videos from the "Vimeo" platform of the third party provider IAC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, NY 10011, USA. Privacy policy: https://vimeo.com/privacy, Opt-Out: https://vimeo.com/opt_out.

## 13. Social Media Presences

You can find me with presences within social networks and platforms, so that I can communicate with you there as well and inform you about my  services. I would like to point out that your data may be processed outside the European Union and that the data is usually processed there for market research and advertising purposes. User profiles can be created from the user behaviour and the resulting interests of the users. These user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For this purpose, cookies may be stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behaviour and interests of the users are stored. Other data may also be stored in these user profiles, especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them.

The processing of users' personal data is based on my legitimate interest in the broadest possible communication with my  users in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f DSGVO. If the respective social networks obtain consent for the data processing, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
