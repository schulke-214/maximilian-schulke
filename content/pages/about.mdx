# Hi there! :)

My name is max :) â€“ i am a software developer and enthousiast living in berlin, germany. I am working at moccu (a berlin based design agency) as frontend developer and studying media computer science at th brandenburg in the spare time. I was born in 2000 and grew up in bielefeld.

The *black boxes* of computer science are fascinating me - everything that has to do with hardware, compiler and language design & math is just blowing my mind.

From a technical point of view: Im currently writing alot of stuff in **rust & typescript** (or other functional languages). My job requires in-depth javascript knowledge, altough i have some issues with 
javascript's language design i enjoy writing smart and readable code in it!

Since i like to hack around with my os, i enjoy using linux as my daily driver.
