# Hi folks! ðŸ¥³

My name is max - i was born in 2000 and grew up in bielefeld
(nrw, germany). I am a software developer and enthousiast,
currently living in berlin, germany together with my awesome
girlfriend and two (even more awesome) cats. Right now i am
working at moccu (a berlin based digital design agency) as frontend
developer and studying media computer science at th brandenburg
in the spare time.

The *black boxes* of computer science are fascinating me -
i like to research and hack on things which are a bit more
unusual than todo apps (compiler, window manager, emulators..).
Everything that has to do with hardware, language design, math
& operating systems is just blowing my mind. Disclaimer:
I still have alot to learn to get somewhat proficient in those topics -
i use this as a platform to document my learning progress and
to help and entertain other interested folks - so if you find
anything inacurate, please file an issue at github and i'll fix it!

From a technical point of view: Im currently writing alot of stuff
in **rust + typescript** and sometimes in haskell (or other functional
languages - i like functional languages ðŸ¤“ (even if i dont fully
understand them yet)). My job requires in-depth javascript knowledge,
altough i have some "issues" with javascript's language design
(where should i start.. ðŸ˜†) I still enjoy writing smart and readable
code in it!
