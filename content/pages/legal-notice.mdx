## Disclaimer of liability

### Liability for contents

As a service provider, i am responsible for the content on these pages according
to § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to
10 TMG i am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored information from third
parties or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations
to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain
unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the
time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. I will remove these contents immediately

### Liability for links

My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents
i have no influence. Therefore i cannot assume any liability for these external
contents. The respective provider or operator of the sites is always responsible
for the contents of the linked sites. The linked pages were checked for possible
legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not identified at
the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages
is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If i become
aware of any infringements, i will remove such links immediately.

the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, third-party content is
identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
please inform me accordingly. If i become aware of any infringements, i will remove
such contents immediately.
