## Info

Hey :) This blog is just a collection of notes on various topics (probably mostly programming-related). Some are more, some are less well written.
You can find more about me <Link to="/about">here</Link>. You can find the code of this website on <a href="https://github.com/schulke-214/maximilian-schulke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>, where you can also open issues to discuss the posts.
