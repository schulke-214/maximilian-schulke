# Installing NixOS with Full Disk Encryption
This is a quick cheatsheet on how to install an encrypted nixos system in a few minutes. I wrote this while doing so to simplify the research process for others since it‘s not directly mentioned in the official manual. If you find anything outdated / wrong in here, please notify me.

## Requirements
Before we‘re ready to go you should‘ve created an bootable USB Stick with the latest NixOS ISO (at the time writing this the latest NixOS Version is 20.09)

## Partitioning
So the basic partitioning doesn’t really differ from the official manual:
```
$ parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt
$ parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 512MiB -8GiB
$ parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary linux-swap -8GiB 100%
$ parted /dev/sda -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB
$ parted /dev/sda -- set 3 esp on
```

> You might need to replace your device id, you can identify your drive by using  `lsblk`   

Now we have a simple layout with 3 partitions:
* Boot (512MiB)
* Root (Disk Size - 8704MiB)
* Swap (8192MiB / 8GiB)

> Note: Depending on your RAM Size you might need to choose a different amount of Swap.  

## Encrypting Your Disk
Pretty straight forward using LUKS:

> I assume you know this, but anyways: The encryption is only as secure as the passphrase you choose. If you loose the passphrase, you‘ll loose access to your data.  

```
$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 cryptroot
```

> Note that from now on, the device id to reference the decrypted partition is `/dev/mapper/cryptroot`  

## Formatting
```
$ mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/mapper/cryptroot
$ mkswap -L swap /dev/sda2
$ mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sda3
```

## Installing
```
$ mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
$ mkdir -p /mnt/boot
$ mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot
$ swapon /dev/sda2
$ nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
$ vim /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```

### Validating
```
$ grep “luks“ /mnt/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```

If the `nixos-generate-config` command detected your luks partition you should be good to go. Otherwise repeat the steps and check if you forgot something / have a different nixos version (i‘ve only tested this with 20.09)

### Configuring GRUB (Optional)
This step might be skipped, depending on your preference: I‘ll configure GRUB 2

```
- boot.loader.systems-boot.enable = true;
+ boot.loader.grub = {
+   enable = true;
+   version = 2;
+   device = "nodev";
+   efiSupport = true;
+ };
```

### Finishing the Installation
If you‘ve validated the hardware detection and configured your system to your preferences you can actually install it using

```
$ nixos-install
```

> Make sure you‘re connected to the Internet for this step.  

## Reboot
If the  `nixos-install`  command succeeded, we‘re done. Just reboot with:

```
$ reboot
```

> And enjoy your encrypted NixOS installation :)
