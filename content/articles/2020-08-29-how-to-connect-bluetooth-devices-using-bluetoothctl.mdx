Since using linux I frequently had trouble with properly connecting bluetooth
devices (especially the logitech mx keys and mx master 3). For quite some time 
I was using primarily `blueman` to manage my bluetooth devices because it seemed
utterly complex to use a bluetooth cli.

It turns out that using `blueman` "caused" some of the problems I encountered.
Pairing devices seemed to be impossible. It might not be only `blueman`s fault
but it definitly played some role in this whole problem. Since I switched to 
`bluetoothctl` everything works like a charm. It was a bit daunting at first but 
once you figured the basic workflow out it's as easy to use as graphical clients.
(If not even easier)

`bluetoothctl` offers both: an interactive command prompt aswell as a dead simple
cli. For the purpose of this tutorial I'll go with the cli since it's easier to
capture the output of the single commands.

> Just as a quick side note: This tutorial was written for `bluetoothctl@5.X.X`

### 0. Turning On Your Bluetooth Controller

Before doing anything device related, you need to make sure your bluetooth
controller is powered on by running:

```shell
bluetoothctl power on
```

Otherwise you'd probably get an error which looks like this:

```shell
Failed to start discovery: org.bluez.Error.NotReady
```

### 1. Search For Your Target Device

```shell
bluetoothctl scan on
```

Once you run this you should see a lot of junk output. A few seconds should be
enough to find most devices near to your system. If you follow along in the
interactive command prompt you have to enter the command `scan off` to stop the
scan mode again. Otherwise you will stop it by terminating the
`bluetoothctl scan on` command.

### 2. List All Devices Near You

To do any device specfic operations you need to have the MAC address of your
target device to reference it. You can find it out easily by running

```shell
bluetoothctl devices
```

You should see some output similar to this:

```text
Device C0:A5:F2:A7:8C:37 MX Keys
Device FE:EF:40:36:85:0A MX Master 3
...
```

If your device doesn't show up: make sure you set the target device to be
discoverable go to step 1 again.

### 3. Optional: Pair / Trust Your Target Device

If you frequently connect to a device which belongs to you, you can consider trusting
your device.

#### 3.1 Paring

Pairing devices is often required when trying to connect to keyboards and other input
devices. You can start the paring process by typing

```shell
bluetoothctl pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

You'll probably be asked to perform some kind of authentication (like entering a
pin code on a keyboard or something similar)

#### 3.2 Trusting

```shell
bluetoothctl trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

If you want to untrust your device later on:

```shell
bluetoothctl untrust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

### 4. Connecting To The Target Device

To finally connect to the target device you just need to invoke

```shell
bluetoothctl connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

and it should work. Some devices might take a few seconds to be connected.

To disconnect from a already connected device, you just need to run

```shell
bluetoothctl disconnect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

As you see: This cli is really intuitive ;)

### 5. Removing / Blocking Unwanted Devices

One last thing you might want to do is removing or blocking devices you
dont know, like or you just want to ignore.

#### 5.1 Removing

If you want to remove a device from your device list you can do that with:

```shell
bluetoothctl remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

#### 5.2 Blocking / Unblocking

If you don't want a device to be listed when scanning again in the future
you can block them:

```shell
bluetoothctl block XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Since you might change your mind in the future you can unblock already
blocked devices by running:

```shell
bluetoothctl unblock XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

## Quick Summary

Just as a quick recap: To connect to a new device, you'd probably do something
like this:

```shell
bluetoothctl power on
bluetoothctl scan on
bluetoothctl devices
bluetoothctl connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

And to connect to a already known device, you can skip the scan step:

```shell
bluetoothctl power on
bluetoothctl devices
bluetoothctl connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

If your bluetooth controller is already on (which is probably the case if your
working on your system) you can even skip that step and end up with two simple
commands to remember:

```shell
bluetoothctl devices
bluetoothctl connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Being able to control bluetooth via the command line is such a awesome thing:
We can define scripts, run them in cron jobs or write a cli to interact with
our bluetooth devices.

I hope you enjoyed this quick summary of managing bluetooth devices with `bluetoothctl`!
